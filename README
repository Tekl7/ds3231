  DS3231 library for AVR.

  This library implements the following features:

   - read/write of current time, both of the alarms,
   control/status registers, aging register
   - read of the temperature register, and of any address from the chip.
   
   To use this library two additional libraries have to be used:
   Millis library: https://github.com/Tekl7/Millis
   USIWire library: https://github.com/puuu/USIWire

  The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C real-time clock 
  (RTC) with an integrated temperature-compensated crystal oscillator 
  (TCXO) and crystal.
